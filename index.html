            My name is Sourya Sivansh, and I was born on September 5, 2016, at Tarini Medical in Khordha.
            From the very beginning, my family knew that I was special. My name, a combination of Sourya
            (meaning the sun) and Sivansh (a part of Lord Shiva), represents strength, energy, and wisdom.
            Maybe that's why I have always been full of curiosity, enthusiasm, and an unshakable spirit.

            As a baby, I was always active, never sitting still for long. My parents often say that I started
            crawling earlier than most and was eager to explore everything around me. Whether it was grabbing
            colorful toys, playing with household items, or simply staring at the sky in wonder, I always had an
            urge to discover new things.Growing up in Khordha, I have been surrounded by love and encouragement. 
            My family has played a huge role in shaping who I am today. My parents are my biggest supporters, always
            motivating me to learn, grow, and chase my dreams. They believe that I have a bright future ahead, and 
            I want to make them proud.

            From an early age, I showed signs of being a curious and intelligent child. I have always been eager
            to ask questions-why the sky is blue, how airplanes fly, or why the moon changes its shape. My
            parents often say I never stop talking, but they love my curiosity because it shows my hunger for
            knowledge.
            I love reading storybooks, especially ones about space, adventure, and superheroes. The idea of
            traveling to distant planets and discovering new worlds excites me. Science and space have always
            fascinated me, and I dream of becoming an astronaut or a scientist someday. Who knows? Maybe
            I'll be the first person to set foot on Mars!
            Apart from academics, I enjoy drawing and painting. Colors help me express my thoughts and
            imagination. Sometimes, I draw rockets, planets, and astronauts, imagining myself floating in space.
            Sports also play a big role in my life. I love running, cycling, and playing outdoor games with my
            friends. I believe that being active keeps me strong and healthy.</p>

                Inspiring Journey Of The First  Of India During the time of British India,
                the East India Company set up the Covenanted Civil Service (CCS). Later, it became 
                the Indian Civil Service. Like today, aspiring candidates had to pass a competitive
                exam to join the service. But this test took place in England. The article is about 
                the life and accomplishments of Satyendranath Tagore, who was the First IAS officer 
                in India<br>
                Satyendranath Tagore made significant contributions to society. He was the first IAS 
                officer of India. He also possessed remarkable talents as an author, songwriter, and 
                linguist. He championed the cause of women's freedom in Indian society. He worked to
                eradicate societal practices such as “purdah”. His marriage to Jnanadanandini Devi 
                further fueled his efforts for women's progress.<br><br>    
                Satyendranath Tagore's journey as India's first IAS officer left a mark on India.
                He embraced the positive aspects of British culture and worked for social changes in
                India. His longtime work with the Brahmo Samaj and dedication to giving women more 
                power helped make the way for a more open and progressive society.
                Becoming the first Indian IAS officer was not an easy feat for Satyendranath Tagore.
                During British rule, the Indian Civil Service was restricted to British candidates. 
                From the mid-nineteenth century, Indians were also able to write for these exams. 
                Indian Civil Service came into existence in 1861. Indian candidates had to travel 
                to England to compete with their British peers. At the time, this travel was a big 
                problem for the average Indian.<br><br>
